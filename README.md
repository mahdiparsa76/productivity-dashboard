# Productivity Dashboard (HTML/CSS/JS)

A polished, responsive, RTL-friendly **Productivity Dashboard** built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It demonstrates core frontend skills aligned with typical bootcamp curricula: forms, tables, DOM/events, array methods, async/fetch, localStorage, routing (SPA-lite), responsive design, transitions, and positioning.
